# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to build this project to learn and practice coding skills HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built the project to organize everything I learned during the process. While I took notes during the learning process, they were nowhere near organized. This website gave me real life practice in creating the website, while allowing me to organize the material. Through this project, I learned a great deal about the entire coding process. I had never used the terminal before in my life! I now have a good idea of how the terminal is used. I also have a better understanding of how coding languages work together.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

This Prework Study Guide can be used to refer back to the notes from each topic: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each topic has its own section. In the DevTools console, the JavaScript is running, and it will list the topics and even choose one topic to study first!
